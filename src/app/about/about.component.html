<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is my first project build with Angular. This web page displays music information retrieved from Spotify using his API services. </p>
<p>This App displays the most updated music information available at Spotify. The first page is a list of recent album releases avilables. 
This page offers the posibility to search music by the artist name, accessing the serach bar in the unfoldable navigation bar. This app also allows the user to create a list of favorite songs and display them in the  favorites section. 
Some songs offer a short audio that can be listened.
